## About me

** Hey I'm  Sophie, **  a knitter by night (and day too, who am I kidding). I knit slowfashion woolies and homewear, mainly for myself and my friends, however I do take on bespoke projects if you ask nicely ðŸ˜‰. 

This website will soon have tools to help knitwear designers and one day to sell my patterns if I ever get around to writing them up.... 
In the mean time you can see what I've been making on instagram [@sophieknits_](https://www.instagram.com/sophieknits_/)

I'm also an architectual designer, front-end software dev and occasional graphic designer.

Find me on github [@sophiewo](https://github.com/sophiewo)

You can see my architectural design work at [sophieworsnop.com](http://sophieworsnop.com) or get in touch by [email](mailto:sophiegw2018@gmail.com) if you are interested in discussing how we can work together on a freelance basis.

For my landscape drawings visit my wonderful clients Rupert and Arjens at [Meeuwsen Muldoon](https://www.meeuwsenmuldoon.com/).
